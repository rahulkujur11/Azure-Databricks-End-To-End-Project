# Azure-Databricks-End-To-End-Project
I built a complete Data Engineering project leveraging powerful tools like Azure Databricks, Delta Live Tables, Spark Streaming, and PySpark. The project dives into real-world use cases, including Dimensional Data Modeling and managing Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) within Databricks.
